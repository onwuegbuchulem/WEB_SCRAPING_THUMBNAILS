However, readability is more than just programming style.
Integrated development environments (IDEs) aim to integrate all such help.
There are many approaches to the Software development process.
Techniques like Code refactoring can enhance readability.
There exist a lot of different approaches for each of those tasks.
The following properties are among the most important:

 In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, control flow, and operation of source code.
 In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.
 New languages are generally designed around the syntax of a prior language with new functionality added, (for example C++ adds object-orientation to C, and Java adds memory management and bytecode to C++, but as a result, loses efficiency and the ability for low-level manipulation).
He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis, the earliest code-breaking algorithm.
 Programs were mostly entered using punched cards or paper tape.
This is interpreted into machine code.
Programming languages are essential for software development.
 Following a consistent programming style often helps readability.
 Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries.
Techniques like Code refactoring can enhance readability.
